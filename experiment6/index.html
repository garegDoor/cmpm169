				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>In this experiment I was inspired by images I had seen of plants being generated using L-Grammars, so I decided to make my own. You can move the mouse around the canvas to change the amount of rotation between lines and the length of the lines.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Once I had setup an L System class, I added rules for creating lines and an axiom that generated a simple looking plant. I then decided to adjust the color of the lines as the system is rendering to become more and more vibrant the further into the generation. I then decided to add a new rule for circles and incorporated it into the rules of the system. I also made the circle colors change throughout the render to create a sort of gradient. Finally I decided adjusting the settings of the system each time I wanted to see it different took too long, so I decided to make the line-length and theta used in the render to be dependent on where the mouse is on screen.</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>In this project, the main difficulty was setting up a class for the L-System. My first pass at copying someone elses implementation didn't work, so I decided to start over after watching a short youtube video breaking down how L-Systems worked. Then after getting it working it only took me a few minutes to find an axiom and rule to generate what looked like a plant. From that point it was pretty simple to add new rules and have the color, line length and theta change. From this experiment, I learned how to create and use an L-System, which is something that I have always seen as a sort of mystery, so after seeing how easy and fun it was to implement and play around with, I want to incorporate these more into my future works if possible.</p>
