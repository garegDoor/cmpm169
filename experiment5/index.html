				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>In this experiment I was inspired by the Space Elevator on the website neal.fun as well as the lighting from a Genuary submission on openprocessing by CLAUDIO ESPERANCA. Enjoy watching the buildings peacefully grow all the way to space.</p>

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Once I figured out how create both boxes and spheres using the WEBGL mode of the canvas, I started playing with adjusting the scale of the boxes, which when combined with the frameCount and millis() function looked like buildings growing over time. I then decided to add clouds the buildings would pass and eventually the background dims and stars appear in space. The clouds don't move, so because the camera is following the buildings it looks like they are falling. The stars are just small white spheres which get generated once the buildings are tall enough to be in space.</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>In this project, the main struggle I had was figuring out what to do in the first place. I enjoyed placing boxes and adjusting their sizes, especially after using the lighting from the openprocessing submission, but I was unsure for a while where to take the project. Then I remembered the website neal.fun and got inspired by how much the boxes looked like small buildings, so I decided to see if I could make them grow overtime. Which then led to me adding the clouds, changing background and stars. If I were to do this project again I think I would have structured the drawing code differently because the way I did it using individual translations was pretty restrictive and I would have liked to add random generation to the clouds.</p>
