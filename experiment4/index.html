				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>In this experiment I was inspired by an interactable falling sand program on openprocessing, and decided to map that simulation on the pixels of an image. You can use your mouse to drag around the pixels or "sand".</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>When you click and drag with the mouse on the canvas, the particles of sand are given a new veloctiy based on their distance to the mouse and the direction it is dragged. When the page is loaded, the image of the red panda is resized and used to set the color values of the sand particles.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>In this project, the main difficulty I had was transfering the code for the particles of sand which was originall in Pjs and I recreated it in p5js. I got stuck on this for a while and eventually decided to ask ChatGPT to switch it and then compared what it gave, which worked with what I had and the main difference was that I was accidentally using createVector() more than I should have been, which was leading to a bunch of errors and lag. I also had to round the size of the canvas on this page to be an integer value because for some reason the resizing of the canvas was giving it a fractional value.</p>
