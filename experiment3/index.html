				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>In this experiment I was originally trying to replicate a plant growth particle system I saw on openprocessing, but eventually decided to move more towards manipulating the particle system by using push & pop on the canvas.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>When you click and drag with the mouse on the canvas, a new Particle is created, which has a random initial velocity and wants to move towards the center of the canvas. The canvas with all these particles is then rotated over time to create a spiral effect.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>In this project, the main difficulty I had was unexpectedly not the replication of the plant growth particle system, but deciding where to take the project from there. I am happy with both how I was able to replicate the particle system and the unique visuals created by combining that with canvas rotations.</p>
