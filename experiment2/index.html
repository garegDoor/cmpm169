				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>In this experiment I was inspired by a particle system I saw on openprocessing called Pallas by Roys, and wanted to create more interesting vector art out of it. At first I messed around with creating lines at the center of the screen to each point, but then eventually moved on to creating shapes and changing their colors.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>To be more specific I took each particle that was generated in the particle system and use it to create a triangle with the particle that was created before it and a point at the center of the canvas. I then use some trig functions, the position of the vertices and the frameCount to change the color of these shapes over time.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>One of the main difficulties I had with this project was figuring out what direction to take the original inspiration. Some of the things I thought of were: to adjust the algorithm of the particle system to create different emergent behavior, use lines to draw the bounding shape of the particle system, and change the visual representation of each particle to something more interesting. I also struggled a bit with getting my final version of this project to work on this webpage, as I was working in the online editor of openprocessing for most of it.</p>
